ClojureScript+React/Om clone of 2048. This game was written to learn
Clojure/ClojureScript and a bit of React/Om.  If you want to play the
game, just play the "real" 2048 at
http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/.

If you really want to try this version, go to

http://emanchado.github.io/ttfe/

Note that it doesn't even have a score, although you can play the
whole game through.
